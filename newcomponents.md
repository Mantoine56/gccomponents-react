# GCDS Component Implementation Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing new components in the GCDS library. Each component includes a step-by-step implementation guide, accessibility considerations, and testing criteria.

## Design Consistency Guidelines

To ensure all new components integrate seamlessly with the existing GCDS ecosystem, the following design consistency principles must be strictly followed:

- [ ] **Design Language Consistency**
  - [ ] Use the same visual language, spacing, and proportions as existing GCDS components
  - [ ] Maintain the same border-radius, shadow styles, and transition animations
  - [ ] Follow the established component anatomy and structure patterns

- [ ] **Color System Adherence**
  - [ ] Strictly use only colors from the GCDS color palette
  - [ ] Apply the same color usage patterns (primary, secondary, focus, error states)
  - [ ] Ensure consistent use of color for interactive states (hover, active, disabled)

- [ ] **Typography Consistency**
  - [ ] Use only the typography scale defined in GCDS
  - [ ] Maintain heading and body text hierarchies as established in other components
  - [ ] Apply the same text alignment and spacing rules

- [ ] **Responsive Behavior**
  - [ ] Follow the same breakpoint system as other GCDS components
  - [ ] Implement consistent mobile adaptation strategies
  - [ ] Ensure touch targets follow the same sizing guidelines

- [ ] **Implementation Consistency**
  - [ ] Follow the same component API patterns (prop naming, structure)
  - [ ] Maintain consistent event handling patterns
  - [ ] Use the same accessibility implementation approaches

Before development of any component begins, a thorough review of existing similar components in GCDS should be conducted to understand their implementation details.
