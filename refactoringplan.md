## CSS Modularization Details
We've successfully divided the monolithic CSS file into component-specific modules, providing several benefits:

1. **Better Organization**: Each component has its own CSS file, making it easier to locate and modify styles.
2. **Improved Developer Experience**: Developers only need to look at the relevant CSS when working on a specific component.
3. **Reduced File Size**: Each component only loads the CSS it needs, potentially improving performance.
4. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one component's styles don't risk affecting other components.
5. **Potential for Performance Optimization**: The modular approach allows for optimizations like code splitting.

### CSS Modules Organization
- **TableBase.css**: Core table structure styles (container, table element, shared properties, visual enhancements)
- **TableHeader.css**: Header-specific styles (header row, sortable indicators, theme variations)
- **TableBody.css**: Body styles (row styles, cell styles, selection and hover effects)
- **TablePagination.css**: Pagination UI styles (controls, buttons, indicators, positioning)
- **TableFilters.css**: Filter component styles (dropdowns, actions, input fields)
- **TableResponsive.css**: Mobile adaptations (stack layout, responsive behavior)

Each component file now imports only the CSS it needs, improving organization and maintainability.

## Stories Refactoring Details

In Phase 4, we successfully refactored the Table component stories to provide a more organized and feature-focused documentation approach. This refactoring offers several benefits:

1. **Better Organization**: Stories are now grouped by feature/functionality, making it easier to find specific examples.
2. **Improved Documentation**: Each story file includes detailed comments explaining the purpose and usage of each example.
3. **Focused Examples**: Each story file demonstrates a specific aspect of the Table component, providing clear usage patterns.
4. **Reduced File Size**: Smaller, more focused story files are easier to navigate and understand.
5. **Better Developer Experience**: Developers can quickly find examples relevant to their specific needs.

### Stories Organization

We created the following story files, each focusing on a specific aspect of the Table component:

1. **TablePagination.stories.tsx**
   - Demonstrates basic pagination functionality
   - Shows examples of adjustable page sizes
   - Illustrates comprehensive pagination with controls above and below the table

2. **TableSorting.stories.tsx**
   - Showcases basic column sorting
   - Demonstrates multi-column sorting
   - Illustrates custom sorting implementations

3. **TableFiltering.stories.tsx**
   - Demonstrates header-based filtering
   - Shows filtering combined with pagination
   - Illustrates custom filtering interfaces

4. **TableSelection.stories.tsx**
   - Showcases single row selection
   - Demonstrates multiple row selection with checkboxes
   - Illustrates selection with detailed view panels

5. **TableStyles.stories.tsx**
   - Demonstrates various styling options (borders, colors, density)
   - Shows comprehensive styling combinations
   - Illustrates responsive behavior

We also created an `index.ts` file in the table stories directory to organize exports and added a note to the original `Table.stories.tsx` file directing users to the new modular stories.

All story files include:
- Detailed JSDoc comments explaining each story's purpose
- Clear examples with realistic data
- Interactive elements where appropriate
- Comprehensive prop usage demonstrations

This organization makes it much easier for developers to find examples relevant to their specific needs and understand how to use the Table component's various features.

## Testing Implementation Details

In Phase 5, we successfully implemented a comprehensive testing strategy for the Table component and its subcomponents. This testing approach provides several benefits:

1. **Regression Prevention**: Tests ensure that changes don't break existing functionality
2. **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation of component behavior
3. **Component Integrity**: Tests verify that components work as expected in isolation
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Tests confirm proper behavior in unusual scenarios

### Testing Strategy

We implemented the following types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Functional Tests**: Testing interactive behaviors like sorting, pagination, and selection
3. **Visual Tests**: Testing that components render correctly with appropriate styling
4. **Integration with Storybook**: Using Storybook stories as the basis for tests

### Test Files Organization

We created the following test files, each focusing on a specific component:

1. **Table.test.tsx**
   - Tests the main Table component structure
   - Verifies that styling props apply the correct CSS classes
   - Ensures the table renders the correct number of rows and columns

2. **TableHeader.test.tsx**
   - Tests rendering of column headers
   - Verifies sortable headers work correctly
   - Tests sorting state transitions

3. **TableBody.test.tsx**
   - Tests row rendering and styling
   - Verifies selectable rows functionality
   - Tests empty state message rendering

4. **TablePagination.test.tsx**
   - Tests pagination controls rendering
   - Verifies navigation between pages
   - Tests proper disabling of navigation buttons

All test files include:
- Descriptive test names that serve as documentation
- Setup and teardown where needed
- Assertions that check both structure and behavior
- Testing of edge cases (e.g., empty tables, disabled buttons)

### Testing Framework

The tests use a combination of technologies:
- **Vitest**: Fast and feature-rich testing framework compatible with Vite
- **Testing Library**: For rendering components and simulating user interactions
- **Jest DOM**: For enhanced DOM element matchers (toBeInTheDocument, etc.)
- **Storybook Test**: For composition with Storybook stories

This comprehensive testing strategy ensures the Table component remains reliable and maintainable as it evolves.

## Code Quality Improvement Details

In our final phase of refactoring, we focused on enhancing the code quality of the Table component through several key improvements:

### Error Handling and Logging

We implemented a robust error handling system:

1. **TableLogger Utility**:
   - Created a specialized logging utility with different severity levels (info, warn, error)
   - Implemented consistent error formatting with component prefix
   - Added context-aware error handling with fallback values
   - Included data validation to catch common issues early

2. **Try-Catch Blocks**:
   - Wrapped critical functionality in try-catch blocks to prevent crashes
   - Added graceful degradation for runtime errors
   - Implemented informative error messages for debugging
   - Created fallback UIs when components fail to render

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Added validation for required props and data structures
   - Implemented bounds checking for pagination and array indices
   - Protected against common edge cases (like empty data)

### Performance Optimization

We significantly improved performance through:

1. **Component Memoization**:
   - Applied React.memo to all sub-components (TableHeader, TableBody, TablePagination)
   - Implemented custom comparison functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Created dedicated row components for more granular rendering control

2. **Hook Optimization**:
   - Used useMemo for expensive calculations like filtering and pagination
   - Cached derived values to avoid recalculation on every render
   - Implemented useCallback for event handlers to maintain referential stability

3. **Render Efficiency**:
   - Structured component hierarchy to isolate state changes
   - Implemented early returns for conditional rendering
   - Optimized loops and array operations
   - Prevented unnecessary DOM updates

### State Management

We improved state management through:

1. **Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Modes**:
   - Enhanced support for both fully controlled and uncontrolled usage
   - Implemented seamless transitions between controlled and uncontrolled states
   - Added proper effect hooks to synchronize internal state with external props

2. **Granular State Updates**:
   - Refactored state to minimize UI updates for better performance
   - Used functional state updates to avoid race conditions
   - Implemented optimistic updates for better user experience

These code quality improvements have resulted in a Table component that is not only more maintainable and robust but also significantly more performant, especially with large datasets and complex interactions.

## Next Steps
With the completion of all five planned refactoring phases, the Table component is now well-structured, properly documented, and thoroughly tested. We've achieved the main objectives of the refactoring:

1. ✅ **Modular Architecture**: Component has been broken down into logical subcomponents
