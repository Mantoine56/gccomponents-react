- [x] Extract TableBody component
- [x] Extract TablePagination component
- [x] Extract filtering UI and logic into TableFilters component
- [x] Create utility functions in tableUtils.ts
- [x] Update the main Table component to use the new components
- [x] Test each component's functionality

### Phase 3: CSS Modularization ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Split Table.css into component-specific CSS files
- [x] Create TableBase.css for shared styles
- [x] Create TableHeader.css for header-specific styles
- [x] Create TableBody.css for body-specific styles

### Phase 4: Stories Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Organize stories by feature/concern
- [x] Create separate story files for:
  - [x] TablePagination.stories.tsx (pagination examples)
  - [x] TableSorting.stories.tsx (sorting examples)
  - [x] TableFiltering.stories.tsx (filtering examples)
  - [x] TableSelection.stories.tsx (row selection examples)
  - [x] TableStyles.stories.tsx (visual styling examples)
- [x] Fix any TypeScript/linter errors
- [x] Ensure all stories properly showcase component functionality
- [x] Add detailed documentation in stories

### Phase 5: Unit Tests Implementation (Future Work)
- [ ] Create test files for each component
- [ ] Write tests for core functionality
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Set up proper mocking for dependencies

## Code Quality Improvements
- [x] Improve inline documentation with JSDoc comments
- [x] Add prop validation and default values
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging
- [ ] Optimize rendering performance
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary re-renders

## Refactoring Progress Summary
We have successfully completed Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the refactoring plan, resulting in a more modular, maintainable, and type-safe Table component. The original monolithic component has been broken down into smaller, more focused components, each with their own responsibilities:

1. **Phase 1: TypeScript Interface Extraction**
   - Created `Table.types.ts` with well-documented interfaces
   - Improved type safety and developer experience

2. **Phase 2: Component Extraction**
   - Extracted `TableHeader`, `TableBody`, `TablePagination`, and `TableFilters` components
   - Created `tableUtils.ts` for helper functions
   - Updated the main `Table.tsx` to use these components

3. **Phase 3: CSS Modularization**
   - Split the monolithic CSS file into component-specific files
   - Improved organization and reduced CSS specificity issues
   - Enhanced maintainability and reduced file sizes

4. **Phase 4: Stories Refactoring**
   - Organized stories by feature/concern for better documentation
   - Created focused story files for each major functionality:
     - `TablePagination.stories.tsx`: Examples of pagination functionality
     - `TableSorting.stories.tsx`: Examples of column sorting
     - `TableFiltering.stories.tsx`: Examples of data filtering
     - `TableSelection.stories.tsx`: Examples of row selection
     - `TableStyles.stories.tsx`: Examples of visual styling options
   - Fixed TypeScript/linter errors and improved code quality
   - Enhanced documentation with detailed comments

## CSS Modularization Details
We've successfully divided the monolithic CSS file into component-specific modules, providing several benefits:

1. **Better Organization**: Each component has its own CSS file, making it easier to locate and modify styles.
2. **Improved Developer Experience**: Developers only need to look at the relevant CSS when working on a specific component.
3. **Reduced File Size**: Each component only loads the CSS it needs, potentially improving performance.
4. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one component's styles don't risk affecting other components.
5. **Potential for Performance Optimization**: The modular approach allows for optimizations like code splitting.

### CSS Modules Organization
- **TableBase.css**: Core table structure styles (container, table element, shared properties, visual enhancements)
- **TableHeader.css**: Header-specific styles (header row, sortable indicators, theme variations)
- **TableBody.css**: Body styles (row styles, cell styles, selection and hover effects)
- **TablePagination.css**: Pagination UI styles (controls, buttons, indicators, positioning)
- **TableFilters.css**: Filter component styles (dropdowns, actions, input fields)
- **TableResponsive.css**: Mobile adaptations (stack layout, responsive behavior)

Each component file now imports only the CSS it needs, improving organization and maintainability.

## Stories Refactoring Details

In Phase 4, we successfully refactored the Table component stories to provide a more organized and feature-focused documentation approach. This refactoring offers several benefits:

1. **Better Organization**: Stories are now grouped by feature/functionality, making it easier to find specific examples.
2. **Improved Documentation**: Each story file includes detailed comments explaining the purpose and usage of each example.
3. **Focused Examples**: Each story file demonstrates a specific aspect of the Table component, providing clear usage patterns.
4. **Reduced File Size**: Smaller, more focused story files are easier to navigate and understand.
5. **Better Developer Experience**: Developers can quickly find examples relevant to their specific needs.

### Stories Organization

We created the following story files, each focusing on a specific aspect of the Table component:

1. **TablePagination.stories.tsx**
   - Demonstrates basic pagination functionality
   - Shows examples of adjustable page sizes
   - Illustrates comprehensive pagination with controls above and below the table

2. **TableSorting.stories.tsx**
   - Showcases basic column sorting
   - Demonstrates multi-column sorting
   - Illustrates custom sorting implementations

3. **TableFiltering.stories.tsx**
   - Demonstrates header-based filtering
   - Shows filtering combined with pagination
   - Illustrates custom filtering interfaces

4. **TableSelection.stories.tsx**
   - Showcases single row selection
   - Demonstrates multiple row selection with checkboxes
   - Illustrates selection with detailed view panels

5. **TableStyles.stories.tsx**
   - Demonstrates various styling options (borders, colors, density)
   - Shows comprehensive styling combinations
   - Illustrates responsive behavior

We also created an `index.ts` file in the table stories directory to organize exports and added a note to the original `Table.stories.tsx` file directing users to the new modular stories.

All story files include:
- Detailed JSDoc comments explaining each story's purpose
- Clear examples with realistic data
- Interactive elements where appropriate
- Comprehensive prop usage demonstrations

This organization makes it much easier for developers to find examples relevant to their specific needs and understand how to use the Table component's various features.

## Next Steps
Future work includes implementing Phase 5 (Unit Tests) to ensure the refactored components work correctly and to prevent regressions.
